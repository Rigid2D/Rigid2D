	Rigid2D is an open-source library for 2D physics and collision detection written in C++.
	It is functional but still in early development.
</p>
<p>
	Rigid2D is intended to be used with convex polygons.

Code Design:
<p>
	The library is made up of several core classes. They are RigidBodySystem, RigidBody,
	and Force. RigidBodySystem is the class responsible for all RigidBody objects.
	Once a RigidBody is created, it is registered with RigidBodySystem.
</p>
<p>
	The force class is intended to be the way the user (of the library) will make the objects
	move. To add a force to an object, all that is necessary is to create a force object and
	give it a ForceFunctionPtr which is an arbitrary function that manipulates the RigidBody
	in some way. Then the force is registered with the proper RigidBody object.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally there is an ODE solver implementing a RungeKutta4 method used to compute
	how the functions change the rigib bodies' states.  
</p>
<p>
	There is also a collection of methods for collision detection. Collision detection
	is broken into two part - broad phase and narrow phase. Broad phase collision detection
	(used for fast culling of possible collisions) is done by encapsulating the rigid bodies in
	Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB). Because the AABBs are simple and axis-aligned,
	collision checks between them can be done very quickly.
</p>
<p>
	Broad phase returning a positive collision does not guarantee an actual collision
	and so we do a second check in narrow phase. Rigid2D uses the Separating
	Axis Theorem inside narrow phase to provide an exact check between convex-convex
	polygon collisions. Conveniently, SAT also return the Minimum Translation Vector which is
	the minimum vector by which we need to move one of the two intersecting bodies so
	there no longer is a collision.
</p>
<p>
	Using the MTV we can compute the edge-vertex pair during collision. Finally,
	using this information we can resolve the collision in a physically realistic
	manner.
</p>
<p>
	Once the RigidBody objects and Forces are registered, all of the above is done
	simple with the update() command of RigidBodySystem in the main program loop.
