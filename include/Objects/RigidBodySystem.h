/*
 *  The system state array S_ is a collection of states for all Rigid Bodies known
 *  to the system.  S_ = (x_1, p_1, q_1, F_1,...,x_n, p_n, q_n, F_n), where for the
 *  i-th Rigid Body
 *  x_i, position of center of mass
 *  p_i, momentum
 *  q_i, orientation
 *  F_i, sum of forces acting on center of mass
 *
 *  After calling the RigidBodySystem constructor, a specific amount of memory will
 *  be allocated for S_.  It will always be the case that SLength_ >= systemDimension_,
 *  where SLength_ is the maximum number of entries that can be stored in S_, and
 *  systemDimension_ is equal to the number of RigidBodies times statesPerRigdiBody_,
 *  the number of states stored per RigidBody.  Currently, there are four states stored
 *  per RigidBody, specifically position x, momentum p, orientation q, and sum of forces F.
 *
 *  Whenever a user calls RigidBodySystem::addRigidBodies, systemDimension_ will be
 *  incremented by the number of RigidBodies times statesPerRigidBody_.  The OdeSolver
 *  will also be notified of the system dimension change, and will automatically take
 *  necassary actions to adjust for the new dimension size.  If adding RigidBodies to
 *  the system causes systemDimension to be greater than SLength_, then the size of S_
 *  will be realloced.
